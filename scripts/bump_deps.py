"""Nightly dependency bump with a publication cooldown (default 7 days).

Freshly published releases are where supply-chain compromises live; an
unattended nightly bump should never be the first installer. `uv lock
--exclude-newer` enforces the cooldown natively for Python, but cargo has no
equivalent, so `cooldown` post-processes a `cargo update`: every crate whose
new version was published inside the window is reverted to the version HEAD
pins (`cargo update -p crate@<new> --precise <old>`), and so is any freshly
bumped dependent that would just pin it forward again. Anything the rule
cannot decide — a crate new to the tree with no bumped dependent to withdraw
it, a multi-version shuffle, a version crates.io does not report — fails
closed: Cargo.lock is restored wholesale and the bump waits for a cleaner
night.

The written report covers both ecosystems and becomes the PR body.
